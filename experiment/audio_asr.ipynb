       "\" Do you think this makes sense? And by this, I mean this differential in the exponent instead of where we usually expect it. To investigate this, we need to think about what the differential actually means in terms of regular integrals. Despite what calculus students think, the dx is actually a vital part for integrals. We typically develop integrals by doing Riemann sums. That is, approximating the area under a curve using rectangles, and then through a limiting process, we shrink the width of those rectangles, making more and more rectangles, better and better approximating the area under the curve. And so our discrete sum, this Riemann sum, which is really made up of rectangles, becomes a nice smooth continuous sum by this definite integral. And it's kind of like the delta x, which represents the width of those rectangles, becomes the dx, which is really like an infinitesimal width, if you'd like to think of it like that. So back to this question, does this even make sense? Well, in some sense, absolutely not. I mean, this dx is kind of like the width, and it's in the exponent. We treat these areas of rectangles like length times width, or kind of like the function times delta x. This is almost saying like, what's the length to the power of width? I mean, what does that even mean? Certainly, we're not calculating the area of rectangles here. However, I would not have brought this up if there wasn't a slick way to go about things. If we do want to compute this in the same way we're used to computing integrals, we're going to need a regular old dx here. But we can't just throw a dx there, that would completely change the problem. So we need to multiply by one, we need to also divide by this dx. And maybe this is even a little bit ambiguous if we're allowed to do this or not. These dx's are infinitesimals, they're almost like zero. So does multiplying and dividing by these really make sense? I don't know, but it kind of works out. And you might think we've made the problem more complicated. But if we can figure out just what this piece in front of the dx means, then we'll be able to integrate this. And so this is what we have to figure out. And what I argue is that these dx's, these differentials, they're infinitesimal, they're basically approaching zero. And so I say this is kind of like solving the limit problem, the limit as h goes to zero of this exact same setup with the differentials being h. Fortunately, we can compute this without too much trouble. You'll notice if we just plug in zero here for h, well, we'd get x to the zero minus one over zero. Assuming that x isn't zero here, anything to the zero power is one. So one minus one is zero over zero here. This is a good candidate to use L'Hobie-Tao's rule. We can try this limit again. This is the exact same limit if we take the derivative of the top over the derivative of the bottom with respect to h here. Be very careful, we need to take the derivative with respect to the limiting variable here, the derivative of h. I mean, the minus one up there, not such a big deal. The derivative of any constant is zero. The derivative of h with respect to h is one. What's the derivative of x to the h with respect to h? Think of the exponential functions. The derivative of x to the h will be x to the h multiply by natural log x. That's what we have to do when we don't have base e. Here we have base x. If we try this limit again, just plug in zero for h, well, again, x to the zero is one, it's over one, and so we're ending up with just natural log x. And so now we just have to solve this integral, the antiderivative natural log x dx, which is something you've probably come across in Calc 2. Now if you want to know how to solve this in just about 20 seconds, you can click right here, but I'll just give you the answer as x natural log x minus x plus c, which is the answer to that interesting integral in the first place.\""

       "\" Do you think this makes sense? And by this, I mean this differential in the exponent instead of where we usually expect it. To investigate this, we need to think about what the differential actually means in terms of regular integrals. Despite what calculus students think, the dx is actually a vital part for integrals. We typically develop integrals by doing Riemann sums. That is, approximating the area under a curve using rectangles, and then through a limiting process, we shrink the width of those rectangles, making more and more rectangles, better and better approximating the area under the curve. And so our discrete sum, this Riemann sum, which is really made up of rectangles, becomes a nice smooth continuous sum by this definite integral. And it's kind of like the delta x, which represents the width of those rectangles, becomes the dx, which is really like an infinitesimal width, if you'd like to think of it like that. So back to this question, does this even make sense? Well, in some sense, absolutely not. I mean, this dx is kind of like the width, and it's in the exponent. We treat these areas of rectangles like length times width, or kind of like the function times delta x. This is almost saying like, what's the length to the power of width? I mean, what does that even mean? Certainly, we're not calculating the area of rectangles here. However, I would not have brought this up if there wasn't a slick way to go about things. If we do want to compute this in the same way we're used to computing integrals, we're going to need a regular old dx here. But we can't just throw a dx there, that would completely change the problem. So we need to multiply by one, we need to also divide by this dx. And maybe this is even a little bit ambiguous if we're allowed to do this or not. These dx's are infinitesimals, they're almost like zero. So does multiplying and dividing by these really make sense? I don't know, but it kind of works out. And you might think we've made the problem more complicated. But if we can figure out just what this piece in front of the dx means, then we'll be able to integrate this. And so this is what we have to figure out. And what I argue is that these dx's, these differentials, they're infinitesimal, they're basically approaching zero. And so I say this is kind of like solving the limit problem, the limit as h goes to zero of this exact same setup with the differentials being h. Fortunately, we can compute this without too much trouble. You'll notice if we just plug in zero here for h, well, we'd get x to the zero minus one over zero. Assuming that x isn't zero here, anything to the zero power is one. So one minus one is zero over zero here. This is a good candidate to use L'Hobie-Tao's rule. We can try this limit again. This is the exact same limit if we take the derivative of the top over the derivative of the bottom with respect to h here. Be very careful, we need to take the derivative with respect to the limiting variable here, the derivative of h. I mean, the minus one up there, not such a big deal. The derivative of any constant is zero. The derivative of h with respect to h is one. What's the derivative of x to the h with respect to h? Think of the exponential functions. The derivative of x to the h will be x to the h multiply by natural log x. That's what we have to do when we don't have base e. Here we have base x. If we try this limit again, just plug in zero for h, well, again, x to the zero is one, it's over one, and so we're ending up with just natural log x. And so now we just have to solve this integral, the antiderivative natural log x dx, which is something you've probably come across in Calc 2. Now if you want to know how to solve this in just about 20 seconds, you can click right here, but I'll just give you the answer as x natural log x minus x plus c, which is the answer to that interesting integral in the first place.\""
